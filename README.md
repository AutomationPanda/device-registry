# device-registry

This project is a REST API web service for registering smart devices.
A home could have multiple kinds of smart devices:
WiFi routers, voice assistants, thermostats, light switches, and even appliances.

This device registry is written in Python using Flask, and it stores data in a SQLite database.
It is the web service used for Chapter 6 in *The Way To Test Software* by Andrew Knight.


## TODO

* Docs
* Tests
* Devices grouped by user?
